<TITLE>Summary -- /WWW</TITLE><NEXTID 7><H1>WorldWideWeb - Summary</H1>The <A NAME=6 HREF=TheProject.html>WWW</A> project merges the techniques of information retrieval andhypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.<P>The project is based on the philosophy that much academic informationshould be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow informationsharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the disseminationof information by support groups.  Originally aimed at the High EnergyPhysics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted muchinterest in user support, resource discovery and collaborative workareas.<H3>Reader view</H3>The WWW world consists of documents, and links.  Indexes are specialdocuments which, rather than being read, may be searched. The resultof such a search is another ("virtual") document containing linksto the documents found.  A simple protocol ("<A NAME=3 HREF=Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html> HTTP</A> ") is used to allowa browser program to request a keyword search by a remote informationserver. <P>The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents whichare hypertext,  (real or virtual) contain links to other documents,or places within documents. All documents, whether real, virtual orindexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the sameaddressing scheme.<P>To follow a link,  a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a numberif he or she has no mouse). To search and index, a reader gives keywords(or other search criteria). These are the only operations  necessaryto access the entire world of data.<H3>Information provider view</H3>The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existingprotocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. In this way, thecritical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the increasing useof the system by readers and information suppliers encourage eachother.<P>Making a web is as simple as writing a few <A NAME=1 HREF=MarkUp/MarkUp.html>SGML</A> files which pointto your existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP orHTTP <A NAME=2 HREF=Daemon/Overview.html>daemon</A> , and making at least one link into your web from another.In fact,  any file available by anonymous FTP can be immediately linkedinto a web. The very small start-up effort is designed to allow smallcontributions.  At the other end of the scale, large information providersmay provide an HTTP server with full text or keyword indexing. Thismay allow access to a large existing database without changing theway that database is managed. Such gateways have already been madeinto Digital's VMS/Help, Technical Univerity of Graz's "Hyper-G",and Thinking Machine's "W.A.I.S." systems.<P>The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of dataformat between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of formatbetween a smart browser and a smart server. This should provide abasis for extension into multimedia, and allow those who share applicationstandards to make full use of them across the web.<P>This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities openedup by the WWW project, such as efficient document caching. the reductionof redundant out-of-date copies, and the use of knowledge daemons.There is more information in the online project documentation, includingsome background on hypertext and many technical notes. <H3>Try it</H3>You can try the simple <A NAME=4 HREF=LineMode/Browser.html>line mode browser</A>  by telnetting to info.cern.ch (no user or password. From UK JANET, use the<a href=JANETAccess.html>Gateway</a>).You can also find out more about WWW in thisway.  This is the least sophisticated browser -- remember that thewindow-oriented ones are much smarter!<P>It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own machine.The line mode browser is currently available in source form by anonymousFTP from node  info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] as<XMP>			/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.</XMP>(v.vv is the version number - take the latest.) <P>Also available is a <A NAME=5 HREF=NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html>hypertext editor</A> for the NeXT (WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z),the ViolaWWW browser for X11,  and a skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).<XMP></XMP>Documentation is readable using www.
